# operatoes are the special symbols to perform operations in python or in any programming language
# python alos has its set of operators

# Arthematic
# Logical 
# Relational / Comparison
# membership
# identiy
# assignment

# Arthematic (+, -, /, *, %, //, **)
# % => remainder of dovosopm operatin
# (floor division) //
# exponent operator

# Logical operators (and, or, not)

# Comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
# result is either true or false 

# memebership operator ("in", "not in")
print(2 in [1, 2, 3, 4]) # True
print(2 not in [1, 2, 3, 4]) # False

# identity operator ("is"., "is not")
a=1
b=2
print (a == b) #True
print (a is b) #True valie of a nd b are in the same memory location

a=[]
b=[]
print (a == b) #True
print (a is b) #False valie of a nd b are in the same memory location

# (=, +=, -=, /=)
# a = a + 1 is same as a += 1

# precendence is is the rule which defiens whoch opration to execute firsl

# if two operators have the same precenndence then associativity is taken into consideration
# associativuty in pthing goes from left to right

# but only exception is ** oprator, is goes from right to left
a = 3 ** 2 ** 2
